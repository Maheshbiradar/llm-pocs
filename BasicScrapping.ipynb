      "Research from NTT DATA finds that as GenAI adoption rises, new pressures on return of investment are at the forefront of the challenges facing the banking industry.\n",
      "February 10, 2025\n",
      "NTT DATA Group Corporation\n",
      "Tokyo - February 10, 2025 -\n",
      "NTT DATA\n",
      ", a global digital business and IT services leader, has today launched a new global research report uncovering the use of generative AI (GenAI) in the banking sector worldwide. The report, titled \"Intelligent banking in the Age of AI\", has found that despite the growing adoption of GenAI technology in the banking industry, banks and financial institutions are split when it comes to outcome-based strategies - only half of banks (50%) see it as a tool for improving productivity and efficiency. Similarly, half (49%) believe it can be used for reducing operational IT spend.\n",
      "Transforming Banking Through GenAI\n",
      "GenAI is more disruptive than any previous advance in banking technology. It is less a question of if, but when banks embrace this technology, due to its transformative ability to embed intelligence at every layer of the banking ecosystem, from core banking to front-end systems. GenAI already making waves in the banking industry, with 6 in 10 organizations (58%) already fully embracing its transformative potential, an increase from 2023, when only 45% of organizations had fully embraced GenAI, according to NTT DATA's research.\n",
      "\"Generative AI represents a pivotal moment for the banking industry,\" said Robb Rasmussen, Head of Global Marketing & Communications, NTT DATA. \"While the potential benefits are enormous, the challenges of implementing GenAI are complex and varied, requiring careful navigation and a structured approach. Given the anticipated high spending on GenAI, achieving a return on investment is crucial. Many banks will be expecting GenAI to drive long-term savings by automating IT tasks, improving operational efficiency, and creating competitive advantages, but it's important to note that achieving meaningful ROI requires a clear strategy, tailored implementation, and robust governance at the same time.\"\n",
      "Financial constraints increasing pressure on ROI\n",
      "ROI has become a top priority for GenAI implementations, yet banking organizations are split in their opinions of which strategies are most important to them. Banks have long struggled with boosting productivity, and GenAI is poised to present a solution to this problem, but only half of banking leaders (50%) see it as a solution to current productivity woes. Cost optimization is another area where banks are split, with just under half (49%) are looking to reduce IT budgets accordingly.\n",
      "This disparity is highlighted on a global scale too - for example, almost 6 in 10 US banks (59%) are keen to reduce IT budgets and almost half (47%) want to cut operations budgets, while only 4 in 10 banks in Europe (43%) have IT budgets front of mind and just over a third (36%) are concerned with operations costs. Meanwhile productivity is the most important factor for European banks (46%), yet the US and APAC are placing even more emphasis on productivity themselves in comparison.\n",

      "Differing strategies across differing regions\n",
      "Strategies for realizing these benefits of GenAI differ vastly among organizations too. While around half of organizations are focusing on collaboration between humans and AI (51%) or a hybrid approach with existing systems (47%), over a quarter (28%) of banks are hoping to fully automate tasks and remove the need for manual input entirely. Fully automating tasks is an area which divides opinions worldwide as well, with a quarter of banks in the UK (25%) and Europe (24%) looking to fully automate the process, while almost a third of banks (32%) in the Americas and 35% of Japanese banks are looking to do the same.\n",
      "Robb Rasmussen, Head of Global Marketing & Communications, NTT DATA added: \"It is clear that the ability to balance innovation with fiscal responsibility will define success for banks. However, many banks are lacking in maturity when it comes to this technology and are unsure where to start. Partnering with systems integrators can be a good starting point, allowing them to access the latest knowledge while ensuring compliance with industry regulations. By working with specialized providers, banks can ensure that GenAI implementations can deliver the desired ROI, while maintaining robust data protection measures and meeting both internal security standards and regulatory requirements.\"\n",

      "NTT DATA Unveils Global Insights on GenAI Adoption in Banking: Divergent Strategies for Boosting Productivity vs. Cutting Costs\n",
      "Research from NTT DATA finds that as GenAI adoption rises, new pressures on return of investment are at the forefront of the challenges facing the banking industry.\n",
      "February 10, 2025\n",
      "NTT DATA Group Corporation\n",
      "Tokyo - February 10, 2025 -\n",
      "NTT DATA\n",
      ", a global digital business and IT services leader, has today launched a new global research report uncovering the use of generative AI (GenAI) in the banking sector worldwide. The report, titled \"Intelligent banking in the Age of AI\", has found that despite the growing adoption of GenAI technology in the banking industry, banks and financial institutions are split when it comes to outcome-based strategies - only half of banks (50%) see it as a tool for improving productivity and efficiency. Similarly, half (49%) believe it can be used for reducing operational IT spend.\n",
      "Transforming Banking Through GenAI\n",
      "GenAI is more disruptive than any previous advance in banking technology. It is less a question of if, but when banks embrace this technology, due to its transformative ability to embed intelligence at every layer of the banking ecosystem, from core banking to front-end systems. GenAI already making waves in the banking industry, with 6 in 10 organizations (58%) already fully embracing its transformative potential, an increase from 2023, when only 45% of organizations had fully embraced GenAI, according to NTT DATA's research.\n",
      "\"Generative AI represents a pivotal moment for the banking industry,\" said Robb Rasmussen, Head of Global Marketing & Communications, NTT DATA. \"While the potential benefits are enormous, the challenges of implementing GenAI are complex and varied, requiring careful navigation and a structured approach. Given the anticipated high spending on GenAI, achieving a return on investment is crucial. Many banks will be expecting GenAI to drive long-term savings by automating IT tasks, improving operational efficiency, and creating competitive advantages, but it's important to note that achieving meaningful ROI requires a clear strategy, tailored implementation, and robust governance at the same time.\"\n",
      "Financial constraints increasing pressure on ROI\n",
      "ROI has become a top priority for GenAI implementations, yet banking organizations are split in their opinions of which strategies are most important to them. Banks have long struggled with boosting productivity, and GenAI is poised to present a solution to this problem, but only half of banking leaders (50%) see it as a solution to current productivity woes. Cost optimization is another area where banks are split, with just under half (49%) are looking to reduce IT budgets accordingly.\n",
      "This disparity is highlighted on a global scale too - for example, almost 6 in 10 US banks (59%) are keen to reduce IT budgets and almost half (47%) want to cut operations budgets, while only 4 in 10 banks in Europe (43%) have IT budgets front of mind and just over a third (36%) are concerned with operations costs. Meanwhile productivity is the most important factor for European banks (46%), yet the US and APAC are placing even more emphasis on productivity themselves in comparison.\n",

While around half of organizations are focusing on collaboration between humans and AI (51%) or a hybrid approach with existing systems (47%), over a quarter (28%) of banks are hoping to fully automate tasks and remove the need for manual input entirely. Fully automating tasks is an area which divides opinions worldwide as well, with a quarter of banks in the UK (25%) and Europe (24%) looking to fully automate the process, while almost a third of banks (32%) in the Americas and 35% of Japanese banks are looking to do the same.\n",
      "Robb Rasmussen, Head of Global Marketing & Communications, NTT DATA added: \"It is clear that the ability to balance innovation with fiscal responsibility will define success for banks. However, many banks are lacking in maturity when it comes to this technology and are unsure where to start. Partnering with systems integrators can be a good starting point, allowing them to access the latest knowledge while ensuring compliance with industry regulations. By working with specialized providers, banks can ensure that GenAI implementations can deliver the desired ROI, while maintaining robust data protection measures and meeting both internal security standards and regulatory requirements.\"\n",

       "'# NTT DATA Insights on GenAI Adoption in Banking\\n\\nNTT DATA has released a research report titled **\"Intelligent Banking in the Age of AI,\"** which examines the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) in the banking sector globally. The study reveals a divide in strategies among banking institutions, with many seeing GenAI as both a tool for enhancing productivity and a means to cut costs. \\n\\n## Key Findings:\\n- **Adoption Trends**: As of early 2025, 58% of banking organizations are fully embracing GenAI, a notable increase from 45% in 2023.\\n- **Divergent Strategies**: Only 50% of banks view GenAI as a productivity enhancer, while 49% see it as a way to reduce operational IT expenses.\\n- **Regional Variances**: The emphasis on cost-cutting and productivity varies significantly by region. For example:\\n  - **US banks** are more focused on reducing IT spend (59%) compared to their European counterparts (43%).\\n  - **European banks** prioritize productivity (46%) over cost reductions more than banks in the US and APAC. \\n\\n## Implementation Challenges:\\nAchieving a return on investment (ROI) is critical, as many banks expect GenAI to facilitate long-term savings through automation and operational efficiency. However, a lack of maturity in utilizing this technology poses challenges, necessitating tailored strategies and partnerships with systems integrators to navigate compliance and regulatory issues.\\n\\n## Recommendations for Banks:\\n- Focus on balancing innovation with fiscal responsibility.\\n- Consider strategic partnerships to access the latest knowledge and ensure robust data protection.\\n\\nOverall, the research emphasizes that while the potential of GenAI is vast, successful implementation requires a structured approach alongside a clear understanding of the associated challenges and expectations. \\n\\nFor more detailed insights, the full report can be accessed [here](#).'"

       "# Summary of NTT DATA's Insights on GenAI Adoption in Banking\n",
       "\n",
       "**Date of Release:** February 10, 2025  \n",
       "**Source:** NTT DATA Group\n",
       "\n",
       "## Key Findings:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **GenAI Adoption in Banking:** NTT DATA has released a report titled *Intelligent Banking in the Age of AI*, highlighting a split in banking strategies regarding the adoption of Generative AI (GenAI). While many banks recognize its potential, opinions vary on whether GenAI should focus on boosting productivity or cutting costs.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Adoption Statistics:** The report notes that 58% of banking organizations have fully embraced GenAI, a notable increase from 45% in 2023. However, only 50% of banks view GenAI primarily as a solution for productivity issues, and 49% see it as a means to reduce operational IT spending.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Diverging Strategies:** The approaches to implementing GenAI differ across regions:\n",
       "  - **US:** 59% of banks prioritize reducing IT budgets, while 47% aim to cut operations budgets.\n",
       "  - **Europe:** 46% focus on improving productivity, with less emphasis on IT budget cuts compared to the US.\n",
       "  - **APAC:** Productivity is also a major concern, with 58% prioritizing efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Challenges and ROI:** Achieving a return on investment (ROI) from GenAI is becoming a significant challenge. Many banks are unsure how to start implementing these technologies effectively, leading to recommendations for partnerships with systems integrators to navigate this complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Focus Areas:** The research explores various segments within the banking sector, including Payments, Wealth Management, and Fraud Prevention.\n",
       "  \n",
       "## About the Research:\n",
       "The survey involved 810 banking leaders from around the world, providing insights into the trends and challenges of GenAI adoption across different markets.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion:\n",
       "NTT DATA emphasizes the transformational potential of GenAI but warns that banks must develop clear strategies and governance frameworks to ensure successful implementation and ROI.\n",
