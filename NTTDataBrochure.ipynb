      "Our history is traced back over 150 years to the first telegraph service in Japan. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation then took over the government-run business to support Japan's telephone and communication services over the decades. In 1967, its Data Communications Division was established as an internal organization, marking the beginning of NTT DATA. In 1985, the company was privatized to become NTT, and in 1988, NTT DATA was spun off from NTT. We have since become a major player in the numerous developments of large-scale systems called \"social infrastructures\" that help progress social transformations. In July 2023, we have shifted to a holding company structure, which is a three-company structure with NTT DATA Group Corporation as the holding company, NTT DATA Japan as the domestic (Japanese) operating company, and NTT DATA, Inc. as the overseas (outside Japan) operating company. With this global management system, we have geared toward further business growth. We are a global organization that supports clients beyond the IT domain, providing end-to-end services and solutions ranging from business transformations to the operations that realize the transformations.\n",
